### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2017

+ Projec title: Research on how public take the inaugural speeches.
+ This project is conducted by Yi Xiang

+ Project summary: Inaugural speeches are vitally important as its the first time the new president express envision about the future presidency. And we can explore the public opinion toward the speeches from three perspective: first, what are the sentiments/feelings expressed by the speech, positive or negative. Second, the readability of the speech, i.e how well can people understand the speech. Third, the hit in speech, that is what topics or sentences public most care about after hearing the speech. In general, we look at how sentiment, readability evolve throughout the speech and use the google hit as an indicator of the most "popular" sentences in speech.
